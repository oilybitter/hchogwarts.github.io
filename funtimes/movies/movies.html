                    This is the tale of Harry Potter 
                    (Daniel Radcliffe), an ordinary eleven-year-old boy serving 
                    as a sort of slave for his aunt and uncle who learns that he 
                    is actually a wizard and has been invited to attend the 
                    Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is snatched
                    away from his mundane existence by Rubeus Hagrid 
                    (Robbie Coltrane), the groundskeeper for Hogwarts, and 
                    quickly thrown into a world completely foreign to both 
                    him and the viewer. Famous for an incident that happened at 
                    his birth, Harry makes friends easily at his new school. He 
                    soon finds, however, that the wizarding world is far more 
                    dangerous for him than he would have imagined, and he quickly 
                    learns that not all wizards are ones to be trusted. - Carly

                            Forced to spend his summer holidays with his muggle relations, Harry Potter 
                            (Daniel Radcliffe) gets a real shock when he gets a surprise visitor: Dobby 
                            (Toby Jones) the house-elf, who warns Harry against returning to Hogwarts, for 
                            terrible things are going to happen. Harry decides to ignore Dobby's warning and 
                            continues with his pre-arranged schedule. But at Hogwarts, strange and terrible things 
                            are indeed happening. Harry is suddenly hearing mysterious voices from inside the walls, 
                            muggle-born students are being attacked, and a message scrawled on the wall in blood puts 
                            everyone on his or her guard, "The Chamber Of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies Of The Heir,

                            Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is having a tough time with his relatives (yet again). 
                            He runs away after using magic to inflate Uncle Vernon's (Richard Griffiths') sister Marge 
                            (Pam Ferris), who was being offensive towards Harry's parents. Initially scared for using 
                            magic outside the school, he is pleasantly surprised that he won't be penalized after all. 
                            However, he soon learns that a dangerous criminal and Voldemort's trusted aide Sirius Black 
                            (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban Prison and wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. 
                            To worsen the conditions for Harry, vile creatures called Dementors are appointed to guard the 
                            school gates and inexplicably happen to have the most horrible effect on him. Little does Harry 
                            know that by the end of this year, many holes in his past (whatever he knows of it) will be 
                            filled up and he will have a clearer vision of what the future has in store. - Soumitra

                            enjoying the summer vacation with his friends. They get the tickets to The Quidditch 
                            World Cup Final, but after the match is over, people dressed like Lord Voldemort's 
                            (Ralph Fiennes') "Death Eaters" set a fire to all of the visitors' tents, coupled with 
                            the appearance of Voldemort's symbol, the "Dark Mark" in the sky, which causes a frenzy 
                            across the magical community. That same year, Hogwarts is hosting "The Triwizard Tournament",

                            magical object called "The Goblet of Fire". On the night of selection, however, the Goblet 
                            spews out four names instead of the usual three, with Harry unwittingly being selected as 
                            the Fourth Champion. Since the magic cannot be reversed, Harry is forced to go with it and

                        After a lonely summer on Privet Drive, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) returns to a Hogwarts 
                        full of ill-fortune. Few of students and parents believe him or Dumbledore 
                        (Sir Michael Gambon) that Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is really back. 
                        The ministry had decided to step in by appointing a new Defense Against 
                        the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), who proves to be the 
                        nastiest person Harry has ever encountered. Harry also can't help stealing glances with the 
                        beautiful Cho Chang (Katie Leung). To top it off are dreams that Harry can't explain, and a 
                        mystery behind something for which Voldemort is searching. With these many things, Harry 
                        begins one of his toughest years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. - HPFAN
